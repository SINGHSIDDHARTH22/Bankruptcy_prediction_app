# Bankruptcy_prediction_app
**Project Title:** Bankruptcy Prediction Application using Deep Learning

**Problem Addressed:** Developed a cutting-edge web application aimed at predicting the likelihood of companies filing for bankruptcy. This solution addresses the need for proactive financial risk assessment in the business and investment sectors.

**Model Development:**

Quantitative Analysis with Deep Learning: Engineered a sophisticated deep learning model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This model is adept at processing and learning from complex, multidimensional financial datasets.

Data Processing and Model Training: Implemented advanced data preprocessing techniques to structure vast financial datasets for model training. Utilized gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms for effective model parameter optimization.

Predictive Analytics: The model is capable of analyzing historical financial data to predict potential bankruptcy scenarios, providing a crucial tool for decision-making in finance and investment.

**Technology Stack:**

Django: Utilizing Django for the backend development, ensuring a robust, secure, and scalable server-side architecture.

React JS: Developing the frontend using React JS, creating a highly interactive and user-friendly interface.

Machine Learning: Employing TensorFlow and Keras alongside Python for building and training the deep learning models.

**Leadership and Team Management:**

Leading and managing a team of four, directing efforts across machine learning model development, frontend, and backend integrations.
Coordinated the entire project lifecycle, from conception and funding acquisition (INR 200,000) to development and testing.
